# Installation
In order to run the code a simple Anaconda distribution of Python will be enough. 

If you are not using Anaconda you need to install the following packages using pip:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

# Motivation

For this project I will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles. 

The project is part of the fourth term of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

# Instructions
The Jupyter notebook `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` will run you through the full analysis.

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Thanks for creating this great learning experience.
